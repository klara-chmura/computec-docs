# FIFO, FEFO, FMFO Queues

In this guide, you'll find descriptions of FIFO, FEFO, and FMFO queue types for handling items managed by Batches, Serial Numbers, and Items not managed by Batches or Serial Numbers.

## Batch Managed Items

The queue type for Batch Managed Items depends on whether ProcessForce is installed:

- **With ProcessForce Installed** - The queue type follows the ProcessForce settings.

- **Without ProcessForce Installed** - You can set the queue type by navigating to: [Custom Configuration → Manager → Enable Batch Management → Set Default Settings.](../administrator-guide/custom-configuration/custom-configuration-functions/manager/batch-management-manager.md)

Here's a breakdown of each queue type:

- **FEFO** (First Expiry, First Out) - The queue is determined by 'ExpDate' (and 'U_ExpiryTime 'if ProcessForce is installed). This method ensures items with the earliest expiry are dispatched first.

- **FMFO** (First Manufacture, First Out) - The queue relies on the 'MnfDate', sending items produced earlier out first.

- **FIFO** (First In, First Out) - The queue is based on 'InDate', releasing the items in the order they arrived.

## Managed and Not Managed Items

For items managed by Serial Numbers or neither by Batches nor Serial Numbers, FIFO is always applied. This is implemented by ProcessForce and takes into account the document creation date in ILM.

When items are transferred to a warehouse post-receipt, the transfer date is considered the latest and used for queue management.

:::info
For FEFO-managed items, if there is no 'ExpDate' set for a Batch using this queue type, the system defaults to recognizing it as the earliest date during location-based searches in this queue type. This ensures proper sequence management based on available expiry dates.
