## Examples

### Example 1

The scanned code consists of the following URL address: `https://address.com/ItemCode/BatchNumber/dd-mm-yyyy`.

    We want to extract and pass the following information to CompuTec WMS from this address: Item Code, Batch Number, and Expiry Date, with the date converted to the YYMMDD format.

    1. Create a new decoder.
    2. Create the following variables:

        1. Internal variables:

            1. Day.
            2. Month.
            3. Year
        2. Output variables:

            1. BatchNumber (GS1 Code 10, pass to output: enabled).
            2. ItemCode (GS1 Code 91, pass to output: enabled).
            3. ExpireDate (GS1 Code 17, pass to output: enabled).
    3. Create the following rules:

        1. Regexp type rule (rule name 1)

            1. Set the input variables to BARCODE.
            2. Set the following output variables: BatchNumber, ItemCode, Day, Month, Year.
            3. Set the following for the regular expressions:
                ```ruby
                ^https?:\/\/.*?\/(?\<ItemCode>[^\/]+)\/(?\<BatchNumber>[^\/]+)\/(?\<Day>\d{2})-(?\<Month>\d{2})-(?\<Year>\d{4})$.
                ```

        2. An SQL-type rule (rule name 2).

            1. Set the following input variables: Day, Month, Year.
            2. Set the following output variables: ExpireDate.
            3. For the SQL query, set:
                                ```sql
                                SELECT Right('@Year',2) || '@Month' || '@Day' as "ExpireDate" FROM DUMMY
                                ```

    4. Save rules and decoder.
    5. Test.

        ![Test](./media/wms-decoder-testing-2.webp)

### Example 2

The scanned code includes the 3202 prefix, which is not natively supported in CompuTec WMS. We want this data to be recognized as a quantity, with the last two digits representing the decimal places.

    1. Create a decoder.
    2. Create the following variables (check the USE GS1 Decoder option)

        1. Input variables:

            InputQuantity (GS1 Code 3202).
        2. Output variables:

            Quantity (GS1 Code Quantity, pass to output: enabled)
    3. Create the following rules:

        1. An SQL-type rule (rule name 1)

            1. Set input variables to InputQuantity.
            2. Set output variables to Quantity.
            3. Set the following SQL query:

                        ```sql
                        SELECT CASE WHEN LENGTH('@InputQuantity') > 0 THEN LEFT('@InputQuantity',4) || '.' || RIGHT('@InputQuantity', 2) ELSE '' END AS "Quantity" FROM DUMMY
                        ```

    4. Save the rules and decoder.
    5. Test the decoder to ensure it functions as expected.

    ![Barcode Definition](./media/wms-decoder-testing-3.webp)

### Example 3

You can display messages in WMS by creating custom queries. In the output, select ErrorMessage from the available options.

![Error Message](./media/error-message.png)

Here’s an example of a query you can use:

```sql
SELECT
 CASE WHEN '@ItemCode' = 'N1' THEN '' ELSE 'bad item [test error msg]' END AS "ErrorMsg"
,'@ItemCode' AS "ItemCodeOut"
FROM DUMMY
```

Watch the demonstration video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JUxu5RUcvA). This video shows how to configure and display messages in the CompuTec WMS client using Barcoder Setup.

You can also use your own query and rules. Below are some examples:
