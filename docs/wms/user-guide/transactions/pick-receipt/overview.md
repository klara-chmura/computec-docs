## Picking Items from Production

### Overview of Items List

The Items to pick window appears with Items contained on a base Pick Receipt document.

Click an Item row to set its quantity. You can also do this by scanning a barcode with an Item prefix. From this step, the user can pick the Items in various ways. Below you can find a description of their most common use cases.
    ![Items to Pick Receipt](./media/items-to-pick-receipt.png)

### Use Case 1: Continuous receipt from the production of Batch/Serial/none managed Item

<details>
<summary>Click here to expand workflow description...</summary>
<div>
CompuTec WMS allows a user to receive Items directly on quantity inputting. In this workflow, a user can receive the quantity of an Item to a Warehouse just after inputting the quantity or quantity and distribution number – it is required to check the option for Auto Receipt turned on in CompuTec Processforce settings. This solution is suitable for environments where production is a continuous process, and users prefer to pick quantities one after another rather than going to document remarks and then saving.

1. The user starts the process from Items to the pick screen with the Pick Receipt document contents as rows. Item is opened by manual selection or barcode scanning.

**Example of barcode for Product-01...**

All barcodes presented below can be used to open Item Product-01 on the screens below. Learn more from our barcode scanning page for more details.

GS1 Barcode that contains Item code with CompuTec WMS Prefix 91

![Barcode](./media/barcode-01.PNG)

GS1 Barcode that contains BMI02 Global Trade Item Number with prefix 02 (if GTIN is stored in SAP Item Master Data Barcode field)

![Barcode](./media/barcode-02.PNG)

GS1 Barcode that contains Product-01 Item code with CompuTec Prefix, Batch number with prefix ten, and quantity with prefix 37. This barcode can also contain GTIN with 02 prefixes instead Item Code with 91 prefixes. Used for solutions when materials are labeled before placing them in a system.

![Barcode](./media/barcode-03.PNG)

![Items to Pick Receipt](./media/items-to-pick-receipt-01.png)
2. After opening the Item user have to choose Storage Unit options or skip this screen. For detailed impact of SU options, see use cases 3 and 4.

![SU Options](./media/su-options.png)
3. On the next screen, a user has to enter quantity, bin location if applicable, and details for the receipted Item. Note that when the Auto receipt option is turned on, materials are available to be moved elsewhere around the Warehouse **just after clicking the Save button**. After pressing it in each transaction receipted quantity will increase by the receipted amount, and the screen will be ready for the next receipt. Cleaning Batch, Serial and quantity box can be turned off in Custom Configuration.

**Example of Bin location barcode**
![Bin Location](./media/bin-location.png)
4. On the next screen user has to enter quantity and details for the receipted Item. Note that when Auto receipt option is turned on materials are available to be moved elsewhere around the Warehouse just after clicking save button. After pressing it in each transaction receipted quantity will increase by receipted amount and screen be ready for a next receipt. For Batch managed Items we can turn on in Custom Configuration cleaning Batch and quantity boxes to force user to input right data when screen is used without leaving.
![Item Batches Serials](./media/items-batches-serials.png)

Both for Serial and Batch managed Items, there is a button for automatic Serial Numbers / Batch generation. Each iteration of generating Serial Numbers or Batch, counts as a Pick. That means, by default, generating 3 Batches will causes 3 updates to the Pick Receipt document. Taking into account the possibility of "PF Auto Receipt" option enabled, 3 Goods Receipt documents will be created from those 3 updates.
5. After required quantity is receipted we can push red exit button to go back to the Items list. All Items received during the previous actions are already in the Warehouse.

### Use Case 2: Continuous Picking from production of Batch/Serial/none managed item with optional Pick Receipt

<details>
<summary>Click here to expand workflow description...</summary>
<div>
CompuTec WMS user can allocate Items to picked status during pick receipt process and optionally receipt them on document saving – requirement is option for Auto Receipt turned off in CompuTec Processforce settings.

1. User is starting process from Items to pick screen with Pick Receipt document contents as rows. Item is opened by manual selection or barcode scanning.

    **Example of barcode for Product-01...**

    All of the barcodes presented below can be used to open Item Product-01 on the screens below. Learn more from our barcodes scanning page for more details.

    GS1 Barcode that contains item code with CompuTec WMS Prefix 91

    GS1 Barcode that contains Product-01 Item code with CompuTec Prefix, Batch number with prefix 10 and quantity with prefix 37 this barcode can also contain GTIN with 02 prefix instead Item Code with 91 prefix. Used for solutions when materials are labelled before placing them in a system.

    ![Barcode](./media/barcode-22.PNG)
    ![Items to Pick Receipt](./media/items-to-pick-receipt-06.png)

2. After opening Item user have to choose Storage Unit options or skip this screen. For detailed impact of SU options see use cases 3 and 4.

    ![SU Options](./media/su-options-04.png)

3. User have to choose Bin Location where Item would be allocated during the process. Bin location can be scanned or selected manually. On the top of the list there are shown Bin Locations where receipted Item is already present.

    **Example of Bin location barcode**

    ![To Bin](./media/to-bin-04.png)

4. On the next screen user have to enter the quantity and details for the picked Item. After pressing the save button on this screen picked quantity will increase by the desired amount, and the screen will be ready for the next pick. For Batch managed Items, we can turn on in Custom Configuration cleaning Batch and quantity boxes to force the user to input the right data when the screen is used without leaving.

    ![items Batches Serials](./media/items-batches-serials-03.png)

5. After the required quantity is picked, the user can push the red exit button to return to the Items list.

    ![Items to Pick Receipt](./media/items-to-pick-receipt-07.png)

6. All Items received during previous actions are in **picked status** and **are not available for moving them around Warehouse by other employees.**

    ![Items to Pick Receipt](./media/items-to-pick-receipt-08.png)

7. Next step is Production Goods Receipt generation in CompuTec WMS or SAP Business One.

    1. **Production Goods Receipt in CompuTec WMS**

    To create a Production Goods Receipt from the WMS level, the user must click the right arrow after turning back from the quantity allocation screen. On the Receipt Remarks screen, users must choose document series (or leave the default one) and can add remarks to the document. Click the save button after that.

    ![Production Receipt Remarks](./media/production-receipt-remarks-01.png)
    2. **Production Goods Receipt in SAP Business One.**
    After Picking Items without receipting in CompuTec WMS, another user can open the Pick Receipt document to finish receipting from the production process in SAP. Example situation is given – when one user is responsible for Batch/quantity allocating and the other for produced materials approval. In this scenario, on fulfilled in WMS Pick Receipt user have to use the "Production Goods Receipt" option in SAP.

![SAP Goods Receipt](./media/sap-goods-receipt.png)

## Storage Unit Statuses

SUs can be used in ProcessForce Pick Receipt documents after choosing a related option in the Options form.

The **Continue** option chooses a Pick Receipt SU with a **CR – Created** – status in a database/document.

The **New SU** option creates a new SU in the document upon saving a pick (the Save icon in the Quantity form saves a SU to a document and Update Each Pick saves the Pick Receipt to a database. If there already was an SU in this Pick, then the latest SU with the CR status will change its status to **PR – Production**. An SU with this status cannot be edited anymore. Statuses of these Sus can be checked in the @CT_WMS_OSTU table.

The **New SU Each Qty** option creates a new SU upon every new pick in the Quantity form (clicking the Save icon) or as many SUs, as many Serial Numbers / Batches are generated using the Automatic Creation option, e.g. 5 Batches, 5 Items each will generate 5 SUs1. If you create 5 SUs, 4 of them will be with the PR status and the fifth one will be with the CR status (which allows you to pack it with other Items).

Creation of a Goods Receipt at the end of the transaction or with picking using PF Auto Receipt option, changes status of the SU to **O – Open**. SUs with this status are already available in the SU Info transaction are ready to work with.

The Automatic Creation option does not work with the Update each pick option due to the application performance (saving to a database so many entries slow down the performance).
