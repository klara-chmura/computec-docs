# Warehouse Info

The Lookup process allows quickly searching and displaying inventory information on a specific Warehouse, Batch, Serial, and Item.

---

To check Warehouse Information, click Whs. Info:

![Start](./media/WhseInfo5.webp)

Four options are available:

![Warehouse Selection](./media/WhseSelection5.webp)

## Item Info

Using this option, you can check the Inventory from an Item perspective.

1. Choosing the Item Info option leads to the list of items. Every Item row contains the Item name, Item number, and overall quantity.

    Users can choose an Item manually by scanning or using arrows. A filter on the list can also be used for Item finding.

    Click a specific Item row to get more details.

2. Now we can see the distribution of the Item across Warehouses and Bin Locations:

    ![Item Details](./media/ItemDetails5.webp)

    The header of this screen holds the following information: Item name, Item number, Unit of Measurement, and total quantity from every Warehouse.

    Each row holds the following information: Warehouse\Bin Code, Warehouse name, and quantity in this location.

3. The workflow ends here if Batches or Serials do not manage the Item. Otherwise, clicking a Warehouse line leads to either Batch or Serials details.

### Batch-managed Items

Choose a specific Batch row by clicking or using buttons to get more information on:

![Batches](./media/Batches5.webp)

Specific Batch info is displayed:

![Batch Details](./media/batchDetails5.webp)

The form holds the following information: Batch name, Item name, Item number, Expiry/Manufacturing date, Status, Optional Query Results for "Batch Serial info Details," Quantities on specific Warehouses/Bins. If a user clicks "Right," the arrow will be moved to the next screen where it can be checked where the selected batch is stored.

### Serial-managed Items

If an Item is managed by Serials, choosing it from the Items list and then choosing a Warehouse leads to a list of serial number Items in the specific Warehouse.

## Batch/Serial Info

Go to Warehouse Info > Batch/Serial Info to get information on Batch/Serials:

![Batch/Serials](./media/BatchesSerials5.webp)

A list of all Batches/Serials is displayed. Each row contains a Batch/Serial indicator, the name of the Batch/Serial, and related Item code. Click a specific row or scan the Batch\Serial number to get more information. Batch/Serial number can also be scanned – after the scan, a specific Batch/Serial is opened. If the Batch number exists for more than one item, then the Item selection window will appear.

### Batch
