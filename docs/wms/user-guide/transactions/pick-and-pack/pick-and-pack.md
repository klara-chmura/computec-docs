# Pick & Pack

:::caution
    Pick and Pack are not supported for Items with ‘Issue Primarily by’ (SAP Business One option) set to ‘Bin Locations.'
:::

### Pick and Pack is a fulfilment process during which Items are selected or “picked” from the warehouse and then “packed” into a container for shipping or to be transferred to another internal location such as another warehouse or the production line.

#### The CompuTec WMS Pick and Pack and Production Manager is a tool that supports the pick and pack process by generating Pick Lists based on a variety of SAP Business One documents:
* Sales Orders;
* A/R Reserve Invoices;
* SAP Business One Production Orders;
* Inventory Transfer Requests.

The warehouse operatives can view these Pick Lists on their CompuTec WMS mobile device and record the picking and subsequent packing of the Items listed there.

You can see how CompuTec WMS Pick and Pack works in our demonstration video. > [CompuTec WMS Pick and Pack Demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNzveSz-56w)

## Support of Storage Units

1. New Storage Units
2. Existing Storage Units (support only for Storage Units that have the same Items that are on the Pick List)

A top bar was added – for displaying an Storage Unit that is now in packing mode.

The change is related to the Pick List from the following documents:

1. Sales Order
2. Production Orders
3. Reserve Invoices
4. Inventory Transfer Requests

Support for both preallocation and without it (Custom Configuration: it is possible to block picking from different than assigned).
