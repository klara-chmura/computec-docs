1. The application is installed automatically during CompuTec Gateway Service installation.

2. Go to the WeightScale configuration manager installation folder and run the file "WeightScaleConfigurationManager."

    It is placed in an installation folder, which is by default in the following location: C:\Program Files (x86)\CompuTec\CompuTec Weight Service\.

    - **Printer name** - the name of the printer (e.g., manufacturer)
    - **Localization** - location of our device.
