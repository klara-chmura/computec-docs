# Working on Database with Branches

In this guide, we’ll walk you through the necessary steps to properly configure users and assign them to branches in CompuTec WMS.

---

## Configuration

To configure and work with CompuTec WMS on a database that includes multiple branches, follow these steps:

    1. A user defaults file needs to be created for each user that specifies the branch they will operate in. Refer to the [SAP Business One manual](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_BUSINESS_ONE/68a2e87fb29941b5bf959a184d9c6727/4506da43d8696c30e10000000a114a6b.html) for detailed instructions on how to create and configure this file.
    2. Assign each user to a specific branch in the system's user settings. (SAP Business One → Administration → Users).

## Important Notes

- Every CompuTec WMS operating user must have a user defaults file with the selected branch assigned to them.
- A user can only be assigned to one branch at a time. Therefore, make sure that each user is correctly configured for the branch they will be working with.
