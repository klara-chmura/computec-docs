This guide provides step-by-step instructions for installing and configuring the necessary plugins to extend the capabilities of ProcessForce and AppEngine. By following this guide, you will ensure that the MO360 and PPF plugins are correctly deployed and integrated with your SAP Business One environment. Additionally, this document outlines how to optionally enable MO360 directly within ProcessForce for streamlined manufacturing order management.
